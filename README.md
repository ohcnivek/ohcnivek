### Heyo!

I'm Kevin, a third year computer science major at Georgia Tech learning about the world & how I can do my part in making it a better place with code. This upcoming summer, I'll be in Menlo Park working as a Software Engineer Intern at Facebook. Previously, I was at Delta Air Lines (Delta Flight Products) doing android development(kotlin + rxJava) on the In-Flight Entertainment Team.
