Hey there! I’m currently a senior at Georgia Tech learning how I can do my part in making the world a better place with code. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer Intern at [Aviator](https://aviator.co), working on developer productivity tools. Previously, I worked at [Facebook](https://facebook.com) as a Software Engineer Intern where I worked on internal tools for Facebook's Engineering Bootcamp.
