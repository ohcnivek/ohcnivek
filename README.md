Hey there! I’m an [incoming] software engineer at [Gecko Robotics (YC W16)](https://www.geckorobotics.com/) & a senior at Georgia Tech learning how to make the world a better place with code.

Currently, I'm finishing up school & building developer producitivty tools at [Aviator (YC S21)](https://aviator.co)! Previously, I worked at [Meta (Facebook)](https://facebook.com) as a software engineer intern where I worked on internal data management tools for Facebook's Engineering Bootcamp.
