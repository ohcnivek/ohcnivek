Hey there! I’m currently a senior at Georgia Tech learning how I can do my part in making the world a better place with code. 

I'm an [incoming] software engineer at [Gecko Robotics (YC W16)](https://www.geckorobotics.com/). Previously, I worked at [Meta (Facebook)](https://facebook.com) as a software engineer intern where I worked on internal data management tools for Facebook's Engineering Bootcamp. I also built developer productivity tools at [Aviator (YC S21)](https://aviator.co)!
